## Introduction

I've always been fascinated by hydroponics and the idea of growing plants without soil. It seems like a perfect blend of technology and nature, especially for someone like me who enjoys tinkering and sustainable living. This post documents my first attempt at building a simple Deep Water Culture (DWC) system at home.

## Why Hydroponics?

*   **Space Saving:** Great for small apartments or limited outdoor space.
*   **Water Efficient:** Uses significantly less water than traditional gardening.
*   **Faster Growth:** Plants often grow faster as nutrients are directly available to the roots.
*   **Fewer Pests:** No soil means fewer soil-borne pests and diseases.

## Materials I Used

For this basic setup, I gathered the following:

1.  **A Container:** An opaque plastic storage bin (around 5 gallons) to serve as the reservoir. Opaque is important to prevent algae growth.
2.  **Net Pots:** 3-inch net pots to hold the plants and growing medium.
3.  **Growing Medium:** Clay pebbles (LECA) to support the plants in the net pots.
4.  **Air Pump & Air Stone:** An aquarium air pump and air stone to oxygenate the water.
5.  **Nutrient Solution:** A hydroponic-specific nutrient mix (e.g., a two-part A&B solution).
6.  **pH Test Kit & Adjusters:** To monitor and adjust the pH of the nutrient solution.
7.  **Seeds/Seedlings:** I started with some lettuce and basil seedlings.

## Step 1: Preparing the Reservoir

I drilled holes in the lid of the storage bin, spaced outพอสมควร for the net pots. The holes need to be just the right size so the lip of the net pot sits securely on top.

I also drilled a small hole near the top edge of the bin for the airline tubing from the air pump.

## Step 2: Setting up the Aeration

I connected the air stone to the airline tubing and placed it at the bottom of the reservoir. The other end of the tubing was connected to the air pump, which sits outside the reservoir.

## Step 3: Mixing the Nutrient Solution

Following the instructions on my nutrient solution packaging, I mixed it with water directly in the reservoir. It's crucial to add the nutrients in the correct order if using a multi-part solution and to mix well.

I then tested and adjusted the pH to be in the ideal range for lettuce and basil (around 5.5-6.5).

## Step 4: Planting

I carefully rinsed the roots of my seedlings to remove any soil and placed them into the net pots, surrounding them with the clay pebbles for support. The net pots were then placed into the holes in the reservoir lid, ensuring the bottom of the pots (and the roots) were submerged in the nutrient solution.

## Initial Observations & Next Steps

The system is now up and running! I'll be monitoring the water level, pH, and nutrient strength regularly. I'm excited to see how these plants develop.

Future posts might cover:
*   Progress updates on these plants.
*   Troubleshooting common hydroponics issues.
