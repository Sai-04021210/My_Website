      <p className="text-lg text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300 mb-4">
        I'm <b>Sai Ram Makkapati</b>, a hands-on technologist and creative problem-solver driven by a deep curiosity for how things work and a passion for building solutions that make a tangible difference in everyday life. While my professional journey has led me through the realms of IoT, Digital Twins, and Industry 4.0, my interests are wide-ranging – from diving deep into hardware and open-source software to appreciating the simplicity of slow village life and exploring sustainable practices.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300 mb-4">
        My core expertise includes areas like Asset Administration Shells (AAS), edge computing, and data-driven automation using tools like Python and Node-RED. I thrive on bridging the gap between complex technology and practical, human-centered applications.

      <p className="text-lg text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300 mb-4">
        This website is a reflection of that journey – a place to share my professional projects, my personal explorations in tech (and beyond!), and my thoughts on how we can use our skills to create a better, more interesting world. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and connect with fellow enthusiasts.
      </p>
